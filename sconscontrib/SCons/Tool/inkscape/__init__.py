__doc__="""SCons.Tool.Inkscape

Builders for converting vector graphics using Inkscape.  Specifically,
converting SVG to PDF, PDF + ``LaTeX``, and PNG and PDF to PNG.

There normally shouldn't be any need to import this module directly.  It
will usually be imported through the generic SCons.Tool.Tool() selection
method.
